# Mission-to-Mars

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a web application, that displayed Mars data retrieved by automated webscraping. Chrome Developer Tools were used to identify HTML components, and Beautiful Soup and Splinter were used to automate webscraping. MongoDB stored the webscraped data and Flask displayed the data in a web app. Bootstrap was used to style the web app. For code detail visit the following:
